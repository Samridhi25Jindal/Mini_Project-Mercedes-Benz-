    <h1 style={{"color":"white"}}>Mercedes Simplex 18/28 hp, 1904.</h1>
    <p style={{"color":"white"}}>The Mercedes-Simplex 18/28 hp introduced in 1904 is based on the 35-hp Mercedes. The latter was the first vehicle to bear the name Mercedes (from late 1900). Named after Mercedes Jellinek, the then eleven-year-old daughter of businessman and automotive enthusiast Emil Jellinek, the vehicle marks the definitive departure from the until then dominant primitive design principle based on a motorised carriage, and is thus considered the first modern motor car. The innovative vehicle creates a furore in particular through its successes at the Nice Week in March 1901. Subsequent models, offered under the name Mercedes-Simplex from 1902, continue the success story. The addition to the name, “Simplex” refers to the simple handling required by the car, simple, that is, by the standards of its day. Mercedes-Simplex high-performance sports cars dominate not only the Nice Week races in 1902 and 1903; the 60-hp model also achieves the until then greatest motor sports success for Mercedes in June 1903: Camille Jenatzy, at the wheel of a 60-hp Mercedes-Simplex, wins the Gordon Bennett race in Ireland, the most important motor sports event of its time.</p>

    <h1 style={{"color":"white"}}>Mercedes Grand Prix racing car, 1908.</h1>
    <p style={{"color":"white"}}>The Mercedes Grand Prix racing car of 1908 vintage is seen as the summit of the technical development of its time. The vehicle is based on the previous year's model, having been thoroughly reworked in many details. Among other things, for the first time in a Mercedes racing car, the vehicle body sides are raised up much higher to provide better protection for the driver. The engine, with two low-mounted camshafts, overhead intake valves and side outlet valves, follows the design concept created by Wilhelm Maybach for racing-car four-cylinder engines. From its 12,824 cc displacement the engine draws a power output of 96 kW (130 hp) at 1,400 rpm. The vehicle, with its chain drive to the rear axle, convinces with its balanced handling and ease of operation.</p><br/>

    <h1 style={{"color":"white"}}>200-hp Benz (“BlitzenBenz”), 1909 to 1911.</h1>    
    <p style={{"color":"white"}}>The 1908 Benz Grand Prix racing car serves as the base for the legendary “BlitzenBenz” (“Lightning Benz”) of 1909. This new vehicle is driven by the engine with the greatest displacement ever used in a racing car or record-setting car made by the Benz, Mercedes and Mercedes-Benz brands. The gigantic four-cylinder with a displacement of 21.5 litres delivers 147 kW (200 hp) at 1,600 rpm. Victor Hémery thunders through the kilometre with a flying start on 8 November 1909 in Brooklands at an average speed of 202.7 km/h. With this the 200 km/h barrier is broken for the first time in Europe. The 200-hp Benz is not only the swiftest land vehicle, it is also faster than all the aircraft of its time. In 1910 and 1912 two out of a total of six 200-hp Benz are shipped to America where they set more records. The first vehicle reaches the record-breaking speed of 211.4 km/h on Daytona Beach in March 1910. A year later this record is broken, as a new one of 228.1 km/h is set. The record-setting car becomes known around the world as the “Lightning Benz” or “BlitzenBenz”.</p>
