      {
        show1?<p>Depending on the model year of the vehicle, Mercedes-Benz diesel engines require the use of either diesel grades 1-D and 2-D or ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel (15 ppm sulfur maximum).Older diesel vehicles can use the new Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel Fuels (ULSDF).
        Also, currently there are no fuel additives approved by our factory or MBUSA for diesel fuel vehicles.For additional information about the particular diesel fuel requirements for your Mercedes-Benz, please refer to your Operator's Manual. A PDF version of the manual can be downloaded from the Owners Support page.</p> :null

     <p>What is the optimal tyre pressure of my vehicle? <button id="b22" onClick={()=>setShow2(!show2)}>{show2?"Show Less" : "Show More"}</button></p>
      {
        show2?<p>Your optimal tire pressure is listed on the inside of the fuel door. These tire pressure values will ensure the best ride comfort, fuel economy and longevity of your tires.Pressures should be checked and corrected in the morning before the vehicle has been driven and the tires are cold. Too much tire pressure will result in a hard ride.</p> :null

     <p>My tyre-pressure warning light illuminates on occasion. What does this mean? <button id="b22" onClick={()=>setShow3(!show3)}>{show3?"Show Less" : "Show More"}</button></p>
     {
        show3?<p>There are a few factors that might cause the tire pressure warning to illuminate, one of which is a leaking tire. It is normal for a properly functioning tire to lose air pressure over time. There are a couple of reasons for this: (1) air can diffuse through a tire at a rate of 1-2 psi per month, (2) a tire typically loses 1-2 psi of pressure for every 10-degree (Fahrenheit) drop in ambient temperature. When your tires are warm, whether from driving or being in an enclosed garage, their pressure will be significantly higher than after the vehicle has been parked outside on a cold winter day. This change alone could trigger the Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) warning lamp.

        The recommended inflation pressure listed in your vehicle's Operator's Manual or on the label inside the fuel door is a "cold" pressure, meaning the car has been parked outside in ambient temperature conditions for at least an hour and driven less than one mile since being parked. Mercedes-Benz recommends you check your tire pressure with a high-quality gauge (accurate to 1 psi) at least once per month and not to wait for the TPMS indicator to illuminate.</p> :null

      {
        show8?<p>When a COMAND unit is installed into a vehicle (whether during production or as a replacement) it is equipped with a PIN. This PIN will be associated to the VIN and relies on the communication network within the vehicle for validation. The network check from COMAND is performed at startup, and if the internal vehicle network is not detected, "Anti-Theft protection active" will be displayed.

        It is important to note that this message is NOT related to the vehicle's Anti-Theft alarm.To temporarily remove the message and resume operation of the COMAND unit, press and hold down the COMAND power button for about ten seconds, or restart your vehicle.
        
        Please note that these are temporary solutions. We recommend visiting an authorized Mercedes-Benz dealership to have this situation permanently resolved.</p> :null
